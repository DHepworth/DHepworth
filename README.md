# Hi! Thanks for visiting.

I am a front-end developer with a focus on UX. I started my path in front-end work back in the GeoCities/Tripod days and learned HTML and CSS, moved into designing interfaces, and finally progressing into JavaScript and NextJS. I hope to improve my skills to better my career options and the impact I can have in a web development team.

I enjoy photography, writing handwritten letters, and collecting enamel pins.
