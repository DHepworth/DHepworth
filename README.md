# Hi! Thanks for visiting.

I am a front-end designer learning how to also do front-end development. I started my path in web design back in the GeoCities/Tripod days and learned HTML and CSS but then moved into designing interfaces instead of progressing into JavaScript and React. I hope to improve my skills to better my career options and the impact I can have in a web development team.

I enjoy photography, writing handwritten letters, and collecting enamel pins.
